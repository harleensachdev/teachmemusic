TeachMeMusic is a web-based music learning app designed to support students, especially in remote or underserved areas, in building foundational music skills. Featuring tools for rhythm and pitch accuracy as well as a dynamic score display, it offers real-time feedback on timing, intonation, and musicality. With support for MusicXML and MIDI formats and Optical Music Recognition (OMR) in development to allow uploads of sheet music images or PDFs, TeachMeMusic provides an engaging, accessible platform for musicians, particularly violin students, to learn and practice independently.
